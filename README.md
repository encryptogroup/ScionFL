# ScionFL: Efficient and Robust Secure Quantized Aggregation

This repository contains code to measure the NMSE of secure aggregation when enabling our SepAgg- and approximation-based optimizations on random vectors as described as part of our [SaTML'24](https://satml.org) paper [ScionFL: Efficient and Robust Secure Quantized Aggregation](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/652).

## Usage

Run `python3 -u -m tests.NMSE_benchmark_controller` to reproduce results.
